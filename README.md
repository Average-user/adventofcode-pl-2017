## AdventOfCode 2017 in Prolog. (SWI-Prolog 7.2.3)

#### Project structure:
For every ```src/dayX.pl``` will be a ```src/Inputs/dayX.txt``` in where the
puzzle input would be stored.

#### Usage
In order to see what are the solutions for one puzzle follow this example:

Make sure you are inside the ```src``` folder, and:
```
src$ prolog
...

For help, use ?- help(Topic). or ?- apropos(Word).

?-  [day1].
true.

?- main((A,B)).
A = 1216,
B = 1072.

?-
```
Where A is the solution to the first Part of the day, and B the solution of the
second.

And if you want to see how it works with your input, just replace the
correspondent ```Inputs/dayX.txt``` with your input, following the given format.
