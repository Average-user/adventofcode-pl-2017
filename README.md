# AdventOfCode 2017 in Prolog. (SWI-Prolog 7.2.3)

**Solutions to AoC puzzles in Prolog:** For every ```src/dayX.pl``` will be a
```src/Data/dayX.txt``` where the puzzle input would be stored.

In order to see what are the solutions for one puzzle follow this example:
(make sure you are inside the ```src``` folder).

```
src$ prolog
...

For help, use ?- help(Topic). or ?- apropos(Word).

?-  [day1].
true.

?- main((A,B)).
A = 1216,
B = 1072.

?-
```
Where A is the solution to the first Part of the day, and B the solution of the
second.

And if you want to see how it works with your input, just replace the
correspondent ```Data/dayX.txt``` with your input, following the given format.
